I'm a Research Scientist and Manager at Google DeepMind in Helsinki, Finland (previously Zürich, Switzerland), where I lead a Gemini post-training team working on user signals.
I also work as an Adjunct Professor at Aalto University, teaching and doing research on Large Language Models and their interdisciplinary applications.
