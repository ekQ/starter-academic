I'm a Research Scientist and Manager at Google DeepMind, ZÃ¼rich, working on Gemini post-training (planning & reasoning, distillation).
Before joining Google, I did my PhD at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) under the supervision of prof. Aris Gionis.
In my [dissertation](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/31841), I developed machine learning methods for linking historical population records and for inferring large family trees.
