abstract: Conversational agents offer users a natural-language interface to accomplish
  tasks, entertain themselves, or access information. Informational dialogue is particularly
  challenging in that the agent has to hold a conversation on an open topic, and to
  achieve a reasonable coverage it generally needs to digest and present unstructured
  information from textual sources. Making responses based on such sources sound natural
  and fit appropriately into the conversation context is a topic of ongoing research,
  one of the key issues of which is preventing the agentâ€²s responses from sounding
  repetitive. Targeting this issue, we propose a new task, known as redundancy localization,
  which aims to pinpoint semantic overlap between text passages. To help address it
  systematically, we formalize the task, prepare a public dataset with fine-grained
  redundancy labels, and propose a model utilizing a weak training signal defined
  over the results of a passage-retrieval system on web texts. The proposed model
  demonstrates superior performance compared to a state-of-the-art entailment model
  and yields encouraging results when applied to a real-world dialogue.
