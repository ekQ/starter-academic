abstract: We propose Masker, an unsupervised text-editing method for style transfer.
  To tackle cases when no parallel source--target pairs are available, we train masked
  language models (MLMs) for both the source and the target domain. Then we find the
  text spans where the two models disagree the most in terms of likelihood. This allows
  us to identify the source tokens to delete to transform the source text to match
  the style of the target domain. The deleted tokens are replaced with the target
  MLM, and by using a padded MLM variant, we avoid having to predetermine the number
  of inserted tokens. Our experiments on sentence fusion and sentiment transfer demonstrate
  that Masker performs competitively in a fully unsupervised setting. Moreover, in
  low-resource settings, it improves supervised methodsâ€² accuracy by over 10 percentage
  points when pre-training them on silver training data generated by Masker.
